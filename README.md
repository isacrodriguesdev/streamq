# StreamQ (DISCONTINUED)

*IMPORTANT: This library has been discontinued and is no longer maintained. Please use the @workehub/pipeline library for event processing and message queue management.*

StreamQ was an advanced library that specialized in event processing and message queue management. It offered strong capabilities for effectively handling events and managing the flow of messages in your application.

However, due to changes in development focus and maintenance resources, StreamQ has been discontinued. We recommend migrating to @workehub/pipeline for continued support and future updates.

Thank you for your understanding.
